## Database Setup

This is the database setup folder. The `Subjects.json` file is what we want to move into a MongoDB database.

- Start up a MongoDB instance on your machine.
- Create a new database named `boilerchat`
- Run `node insert.js` (this script will copy the JSON file into the database)
- Once the script is done running, you should now have a working database for BoilerChat to use.
